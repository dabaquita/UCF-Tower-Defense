Populate each section with information as it applies to your project. If a section does not apply, explain why. Include diagrams (or links to diagrams) in each section, as appropriate.  For example, sketches of the user interfaces along with an explanation of how the interface components will work; ERD diagrams of the database; rough class diagrams; context diagrams showing the system boundary; etc. Do _not_ link to your diagrams, embed them directly in this document by uploading the images to your GitHub and linking to them. Do _not_ leave any section blank.

# Program Organization

You should have your context, container, and component (c4model.com) diagrams in this section, along with a description and explanation of each diagram and a table that relates each block to one or more user stories. 

See Code Complete, Chapter 3 and https://c4model.com/

# Code Design

You should have your UML Class diagram and any other useful UML diagrams in this section. Each diagram should be accompanied by a brief description explaining what the elements are and why they are in the diagram. For your class diagram, you must also include a table that relates each class to one or more user stories.

# Data Design

If you are using a database, you should have a basic Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in this section. This diagram should describe the tables in your database and their relationship to one another (especially primary/foreign keys), including the columns within each table. 

See Code Complete, Chapter 3

# Business Rules

You should list the assumptions, rules, and guidelines from external sources that are impacting your program design. 

See Code Complete, Chapter 3

# User Interface Design

You should have one or more user interface screens in this section. Each screen should be accompanied by an explaination of the screens purpose and how the user will interact with it. You should relate each screen to one another as the user transitions through the states of your application. You should also have a table that relates each window or component to the support using stories.
