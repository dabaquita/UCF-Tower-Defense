# UCF-Tower-Defense

# Vision Statement:

UCF Tower Defense is a game where UCF students battle to save their grades against professors of UCF. Unlike competitors like Bloons Tower Defense and Plants vs. Zombies, UCF Tower Defense provides an inclusive format that UCF students can relate to beyond a superficial level, such as levels that look like campus and enemies that look like professors. This will allow our Knights to feel at home even during the Zoom University era. Additionally, UCF Tower Defense offers easily understandable gameplay and a free-to-play environment. These features will present the player with a unique, entertaining experience that they could not find elsewhere. Go Knights, Charge On!!!
